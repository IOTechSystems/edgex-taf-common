# TAF Manager (TM) Overview

In each project, **Test Automation Framework** (TAF) may have,

*	N number of Use Cases
*	Each Use Case may contain N number of robot files
*	With the provided infrastructure, if we want to execute TAF, we need to execute each robot file individually
*	Orchestration of artifacts and reporting has to be handled separately

TM may address the points stated above, (Execution, Orchestration and reporting).
TM has bunch of scripts which will help to execute, orchestrate, and reporting.
